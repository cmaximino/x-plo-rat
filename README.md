X-Plo-Rat software, developed by Fernando Cardenas under the supervision of Silvio Morato, is used in our laboratory to record behavioral data.
Unfortunately, the original software is no longer available in Morato's repository. In the spirit of transparency, we are publishing the installation files here. THE SOFTWARE WAS NOT PROGRAMMED BY US! ALL CREDITS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE CREATORS!

From the (now defunct) X-Plo-Rat homepage: "X-Plo-Rat was born as the need for a economic optimization in recording and analyzing experimental data. The program was developed at the Laboratório de Comportamento Exploratório of the Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras at the University of São Paulo - campus Ribeirão Preto. 
The software was written by Fernando Cardenas, with the management of Silvio Morato. This software was designed by Fernando Cardenas and Marisol Lamprea. Special thankfulness to Andrea Milena García, Flávia Yokoyama, José Roberto Stella, Aninha Cristina Madalena Costa, Diogo Chagas and Juliana Setem for their collaboration in testing preliminar versions. The author of the software wants to specially thank to Robert Nunemaker for his unvaluable help."
